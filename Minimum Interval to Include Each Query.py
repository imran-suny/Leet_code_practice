Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,4],[3,6],[4,4]], queries = [2,3,4,5]     Output: [3,3,1,4]
Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
- Query = 2: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.
- Query = 3: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 3. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.
- Query = 4: The interval [4,4] is the smallest interval containing 4. The answer is 4 - 4 + 1 = 1.
- Query = 5: The interval [3,6] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 6 - 3 + 1 = 4.

class Solution:
    def minInterval(self, intervals: List[List[int]], queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        intervals.sort()
        minHeap = []
        res = {}
        i = 0
        for q in sorted(queries):
            while i < len(intervals) and intervals[i][0] <= q:   # left value choto hole add
                l, r = intervals[i]
                heapq.heappush(minHeap, (r - l + 1, r))
                i += 1

            while minHeap and minHeap[0][1] < q:       # right choto hole pop from minH
                heapq.heappop(minHeap)
            res[q] = minHeap[0][0] if minHeap else -1
        return [res[q] for q in queries]
